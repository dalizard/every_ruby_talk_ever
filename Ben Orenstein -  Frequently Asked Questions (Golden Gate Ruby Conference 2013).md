## Ben Orenstein - Golden Gate Ruby Conference 2013: Frequently Asked Questions

#### Pair.
- The best way is to pair with programmers, because you get to learn. If you pair with people who are less experienced, you get to explain things and you get to know what is really supposed to happen.
- "Actually, I don't know. Let's find things about it."

#### Struggle on your own.
It is easy to doubt your own ability and ask if other people struggle on this. This is normal because programming is hard. Do plenty of struggling on your own but don't feel bad. It's going to take a long time, it's going to be hard, that's the way it's supposed to be. 

And you should be struggling. When things are easy, you aren't improving. If you feel that what you're doing is easy, then do something harder.

#### Admit when you don't understand something.

I just made this decision 2 years ago to just admit things when I don't understand them. In this industry, we are intellect-powered. "How smart is that person?" There is this tremendous pressure to maintain a perception. It's super like "oh yeah, whatever". But don't do that. You trade temporary perception for a chance to actually learn.

The more you are embarassed that you don't know something, then the more you should really study it. (Protocol buffer: Used over JSON when you have 2M transactions/second.)

#### Heuristic to Know if You Are Getting Better

I think the most important is to know: How hard is it to change this code? What is it about writing this code a month ago that is making it easy or hard to change.

Oftentimes, duplication is bad. Law of Demeter is about Structural Duplication. You make the change in one place only.

Test code is code too, so it has to be DRYed up. Treat it better than production code because it has no tests. I think you can get clarity without duplication.

#### Make Friends

THe best jobs in the world are passed through word-of-mouth. So I think it is important to maintain friendships (people you like to spend time with).

#### Underpaid

If you think you are underpaid, you are. if you feel that the value you are providing to the company is low, then you are definitely underpaid.

Just ask people for stuff, it usually works. The only thing you need to know is to pass the Giggle test. If you can say a number and you would, and they would not laugh out loud.

If you ask for something and they say no, that's how you maximize your value. The most important thing a salary can do for you is to make you forget about it.
